# How to Send SMS Messages with Ruby on Rails

_This is the first article in a series of "Getting Started with Nexmo and Ruby on Rails" tutorials.

With the help of the [Nexmo SMS API](https://docs.nexmo.com/messaging/sms-api) you can send SMS anywhere in the world. All you need is your virtual phone number, the [Ruby Gem](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-ruby), and a few lines of code.

In this tutorial, and the ones to follow, I will take you through some real-life examples of how to integrate Nexmo into your Rails application. We will see how to set up the basics, and then we will write some code together to properly integrate Nexmo. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial I assume you will have:

- A basic understanding of Ruby, and Rails
- [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) installed on your machine

## Get Your API Keys

Before we can make our first API call you will need to [sign up for a Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up). Once you've signed up you can head over to the [Settings page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) to fetch your API credentials.
